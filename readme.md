In this project, have a few functions. I displayed the data from fetch, then worked to handle each button to accomplish its function.

I was stack when I displayed the list at first, and spent a lot of time on it, so I was running pout of time. I managed to get each function but I still have bugs.

Also I couldn't refactor my code with modules, so that's what I really need to improve on.
I mostly understand what to do and what I did but I was running out of time and couldn't do much.

There was no joy at all to be honest.
